# About this application

This is a COVID-19 visualization. At the beginning of the webpage, you will see a counter of the number of infected people, number of people that have recovered, and the number of deaths caused by COVID-19. This visualization followed the color mapping channel to represent the three categories of data as: Infected = Blue, Recovered = Green, and Deaths = Red. Underneath all of these numerical data points, you will see the date this data was last updated, and a short description of what the data means to further clarify the visualization. 

Below the summarized data cards, there will be a chart further displaying the data. When you first view the application, you will be looking at a Global representation so the chart will be displayed as a line graph illustrating the number of infected people compared to the number of deaths. You can hover over any point to get the actual numerical value along side the date the data was last updated. You can also click on the graph key to further customize your line chart view and do to so, you simply click on the category you want to no longer display on the line chart. To have it re-display, you can re-click the catergory key. 

Above the chart, you will see a toggle bar so you can view a graph representation of the data specific to a country. Once you select a specific country, the chart will change from a line char to a bar chart. The bar chart will show the infected number of people, the numebr of people that have recovered, and the number of deaths. You can hover over each bar in the chart to see a numerical representation of that number. You can view as many countries bar chart's as you wish, or go back to view the global line graph.
